<h2>Students</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose that <code class="java">student_list</code> is a pre-defined list of the names of the students who signed up for a class. The first name in the <code class="java">student_list</code> is the student who registered first, the second one registered the second, and so on.</p>
<p>Print out students' names along with their registration number, e.g.:</p>
<p>1 Kate<br/>
2 Michael<br/>
..</p>
<p>You can consider <code class="java">student_list</code> defined and use it in your solution.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>  Don't forget to start enumerating with 1, not 0. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
