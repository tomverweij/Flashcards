<p>Please note: for now, when you go to the tab IDE, you can solve this problem only via Pycharm. We are sorry for the inconvenience, we will fix this as soon as we can. If you prefer to solve the problem via a different IDE, you should open it manually and then copy the answer to the website.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, you will need a file â€“ download it below. Your task is to count how many times the word <u><em>summer</em></u> appears in the file. It contains only one word per line, all of them are lowercased. Mind that if <em>summer </em>is a part of some other word (e.g. <em>summertime</em>) you should <strong>NOT</strong> count it. We only need <em>summers </em>themselves! Also, you don't need to enter any code here, just write and run it on your machine, and then enter the result you get.</p></body></html><br>
