language: English
summary: "<p>When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new\
  \ vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards\
  \ show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other.\
  \ Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create\
  \ a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project\
  \ is for you.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/127?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
